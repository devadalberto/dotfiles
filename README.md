# dotfiles

Another attempt to automate the basic setup and configuration of a computer.

The idea is to do it without using tools like ansible.


## Who can use these?
Anyone with a windows OS 10 or 11


## ToDo
- [] Create install files for MacOS
- [] Finish the Windows install files
- [] Get the scripts hosted in a webServer


## Disclaimer

I am just putting together stuff already configured or created by someone else.
If I miss anybody on the Special Thanks, please let me know.

## Special thanks

For all those that shared their dotfiles and all their knowledge already to make this happen.
